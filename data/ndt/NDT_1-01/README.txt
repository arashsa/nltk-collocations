Norwegian Dependency Treebank Version 1.0 (2014-03-28)


General Information
===================

- Norwegian Dependency Treebank (NDT) is a syntactic treebank of Norwegian Bokmål and Nynorsk, developed 2011-2014 at the National Library of Norway in collaboration with the Text Laboratory and the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo, by Per Erik Solberg, Pål Kristian Eriksen and Kari Kinn.

- NDT consists of texts which are manually annotated for morphological features, syntactic functions and hierarchical structure. The morphological annotation mainly follows mainly Oslo-Bergen Tagger (http://tekstlab.uio.no/obt-ny/). Dependency Grammar is used as formalism for the syntactic annotation. The syntactic annotation follows, to a large extent, the Norwegian Reference Grammar (Jan Terje Faarlund , Svein Lie and Kjell Ivar Vannebo. 1997. "Norsk referansegrammatikk", Oslo: Universitetsforlaget). For more information, see the attached annotation guidelines and articles.

- The corpus has not been changed from version 1.0 to version 1.01, but there are some updates to the documentation.

- NDT is available in the conll format (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/conll2009-st/task-description.html) and Prague Markup Language (pml; http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/jazz/pml/doc/pml_doc.html).

Double annotation
=================

- NDT is manually annotated morphologically and syntactically by at least one annotator. A small portion of the material is syntactically annotated by two annotators. This applies to the following files:

Nynorsk:
--------
blogg-nn002_0000, blogg-nn002_0001, blogg-nn002_0002, blogg-nn002_0003, dot009_0000, dot009_0001

Bokmål:
------
ap001_0000, ap001_0001, ap001_0002, ap007_0000, db001a_0000, db001a_0001, db001b_0000, db001b_0001, db001b_0002, db001b_0003, db001b_0004, db003_0000, db003_0001, db003_0002, db003_0003, db003_0004, db013_0000, db013_0001, db013_0002, db013_0003
